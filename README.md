</a> to use it directly

After that you can just paste your video link, playlist link or music link,  between double quotation marks of quallity you want and after that run first and second cell.

### 2- download py file and use it in your PC


#### Installation
First of all, you need ```Python3.x```

To install required packages type in terminal/cmd ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, when you are in project folder.

After installation packages you have to get your `api_id` and `api_hash` from https://my.telegram.org/auth and then paste them in ```config.py```. Also you can change your ```session_name```, it will not make anything bad.

Also change my photo at ```resources/photo.png``` with yours :)

#### Building & Running
Just run ```main.py``` (```python main.py```) and enjoy.
