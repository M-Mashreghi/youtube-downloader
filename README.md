# Youtube-Downloader

Downloads videos and playlists and music and thumbnail with English subtitles from YouTube with the colab.ðŸ˜‰

I created this for poor people who can't access Youtube and have bad Internet, countries like Iran.

## Ways to use

### 1- using colab

For using google colab, you should open the Jupiter notebook by uploading it in Colab or click this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dconIRkgfD5byt2d_hXEqvbl7dghCmqZ?usp=sharing">
    Link
</a> which I share via colab to use directly without losing time.

After that you can just paste your video link, playlist link, or music link,  between double quotation marks of the quality you want, and after that run the first and second cells.

and after the cell ran and is finished you can see your files in the content folder

If your link is a playlist it will save in content/downloads.

and you can download your files by clicking on the ellipsis that is arranged vertically after that click on download, you can download it.

### 2- download py file and use it on your PC


#### Installation
