دانلود ویدیوها، لیست‌های پخش، موزیک و تصویر بند انگلیسی‌ها از یوتیوب با استفاده از کولب. 😉

این را برای افراد بدبخت ساختم که به یوتیوب دسترسی ندارند و اینترنت ضعیف و به شدت بی کیفیت دارند، مانند ایران. 🌍🇮🇷


## راه‌های استفاده 🛠️

### 1- using colab 💻

For using google colab, you should open the Jupiter notebook by uploading it in Colab or click this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dconIRkgfD5byt2d_hXEqvbl7dghCmqZ?usp=sharing">
    Link
</a> which I share via colab to use directly without losing time.

After that you can just paste your video link, playlist link, or music link,  between double quotation marks of the quality you want, and after that run the first and second cells. (do not delete other variables if you do that the code may not run and you will get an error)

and after the cell ran and is finished you can see your files in the content folder 📂

If your link is a playlist it will save in content/downloads. 📥

and you can download your files by clicking on the ellipsis that is arranged vertically after that click on download, and you can download it and save it on our PC. 💾💻

### 2- download py file and use it on your PC 💽💻


#### Installation 🛠️

First of all, you need ```Python3.x```

To install required packages type in terminal/cmd ```pip install -r requirements.txt```, when you are in the project folder.

After that you can just paste your video link, playlist link, or music link,  between double quotation marks of the quality you want, and after that run the first and second cells. (do not delete other variables if you do that the code may not run and you will get an error) 

and after that run the code. 🏃‍♂️

If your link is a playlist it will save in the downloads folder. 📥📂
